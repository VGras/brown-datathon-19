# Brown-Datathon-2019
We use TripAdvisor data to predict if a user will book a hotel, along with the star rating and location of booked hotel using user history. The goal is to move more attractive hotels for the user to the top of the search page.

This project was worked on by Victoria Gras Andreu, Peihong Jiang, Vikram Saraph, and Ashley Weber.

We included some of the data analysis we did in the EDA file. The code we used is divided in three files: base_line_decision_tree,  filter_user_ids, and hotel_decision_tree. These include the code for the preproccessing and our model.
The results of our model and project as whole can be found in the Presentation file.
